                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>A Leasehold property is a property that is leased out by Cerv Properties to a Lessee for a specific period of time. A Freehold property is a property 
                        that is sold outright for a specific purchase price to a Purchaser and there is no limit on ownership rights.</p>

                <h1 class="faq-page">WHY IS THE RATE OF MAINTENANCE FEES NOT SPECIFIED IN THE SALE AGREEMENT?</h1>
                <!-- faq answer -->
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>The rate of maintenance fees is an amount that varies depending on the yearly costs and expenses involved in the maintenance, operation and upkeep of the 
                        common areas in the concerned community. However the Sale Agreement does mention the payment of maintenance fees.</p>

        <h1 class="faq-page">Why does the Sale Agreement mention that if the customer is in default we charge him interest commencing on the date of default and when delay occurs on 
            behalf of the Vendor the Customer has to wait?</h1>
                <!-- faq answer -->
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>As the Vendor cannot accurately specify the date of completion of construction, the Sale Agreement specifies an estimated completion date for construction and
                         allows the Vendor the right to reschedule the completion date within certain time limit beyond the Estimated Completion Date whereby the Vendor can delay the 
                         Completion of the project. The delays arise mainly only in cases where the Force Majeure is a factor.</p>

            <div class="faq-body">
                <p>You would need to attend the Contracts Helpdesk and sign and indemnity form. You will also need to provide us with either a police report or an affidavit signed in 
                    front of the notary public, citing the reasons for the loss of the contract. The veracity of your request will then be verified and if genuine, a new Sale 
                    Agreement will be issued upon payment of a nominal fee of AED 3,000.

        <h1 class="faq-page">HOW MANY DAYS DOES IT TAKE FOR ME TO RECEIVE MY CONTRACT FOR SIGNATURE FROM THE DATE OF SALES LAUNCH?</h1>
            <!-- faq answer -->
            <div class="faq-body">
                <p>For off-plan properties purchased during launch, it can take the Vendor minimum 21-40 days in issuing the Sales and Purchase Agreement after purchase date as all 
                    sales are subject to approval and documentation compliance. The Vendor needs to ensure that down-payment, registration charges and oqood charges are cleared in 
                    full. At times, there is interdependency from Lands Department to get the plot numbers particularly for townhomes or villas which are printed on the agreements.
                     For completed properties purchased which are also subject to approval and documentation compliance; the SPA issuance is usually between 15-20 days.
